Corset-Project
==============

Hello everyone,

The "Corset Project" is still in development phase, but I hope, that you will find it interesting and worth of waiting for final version.

To compile project, please use command:
---------------------------------------
javac -cp "./jars/*:." *.java

To run project, use this command:
---------------------------------
java -cp "./jars/*:." Corset :skin: [:shader name:]

where :skin: is name of skin, which you want to use, and :shader name: is name of shader file from "shaders" folder.

For now there are available two skins:
- RoseNature
- TheGame
- OldFabric
- Rainbow

I hope that you will like it.
